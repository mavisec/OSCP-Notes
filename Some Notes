scan everything.
use the given creds for evil-winrm ---> use nxc to spray in almost everything
once you got the shell use whoami /priv use winpeas you will def find smth.
after you are NT/ authority on the first machine use mimikatz to dump logonpasswords.
and use those hashes to spray onto the next machine. repeat the process find an interesting file there must be something check for internally running ports.
and same if you are NT/authority there get mimikatz get those hashes get a stable shell maybe try to get all the username and hashes you gathered spray it on DC01 atleast you can get a shell on a low level user and then go for DC01 use bloodhound and yes here we are done with active directory
